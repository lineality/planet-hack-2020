# Hello, World

Welcome to EVENT. 

## How to Participate

- create an issue to introduce yourself

- (optional) create an issue to pitch your hack idea

- meet your fellow hackers & browse pitch ideas during the week prior to EVENT

- team formation can happen anytime in the days leading up to EVENT - but
  hacking should not begin until KICKOFF!

## How EVENT Works

- On KICKOFF, join the Kickoff session via Zoom (information on how to join
  will be emailed to you)
- Following kickoff, hackers (whether working solo or in teams) will have until
  END to work on their ideas
- Before ENDTIME, sign up to demo your hack adventures using [FORM] this form
- At DEMOTIME, join the Demo Party on Zoom: everyone that signs up to demo will
  get 5 minutes to show everyone what they worked on - remember, no one expects to
_complete_ something from start-to-finish during a hackathon, part of the fun
is seeing what you can do in the time allotted!

## [EVENT] FAQ

### Is there a Code of Conduct?

Yes: all attendees, sponsors, partners, volunteers and staff are required to
agree with our [Event Code of Conduct](https://developers.planet.com/codeofconduct/).

### Will there be prizes?

Unlike some hackathons, EVENT is non-competitive, and likewise there will be no
judging & no prizes. Instead, EVENT is a collaborative, creative event where we
can ask questions and explore ideas in a shared (virtual) space.

### I don't have a Planet account, how can I access Planet data?

An account will be configured for you in the days leading up to EVENT: you'll
receive an email with instructions on how to complete account setup.

For the duration of EVENT, you will have access to PlanetScope data around the
globe. You'll be able to browse & download data by logging in at [Planet
Explorer](https://www.planet.com/explorer/), or by accessing [Planet
APIs](https://developers.planet.com/docs/apis/) using your new account's API
key.

**Note:** if you _already_ have a Planet account, global PlanetScope data
access for the period of EVENT will be added to your subscription if needed.

### I don't know anything about Planet data or satellite imagery in general,
where should I start?

- You may find this [Introduction to Geospatial Data](https://developers.planet.com/planetschool/geospatial-data/) useful, as well as this [Satellite Imagery Overview](https://developers.planet.com/planetschool/satellite-imagery/)

- For a quickstart guide to usings Planet's platform & APIs, [see here](https://developers.planet.com/quickstart/)

- To browse our collection of self-guided tutorials, check out [Planet School](https://developers.planet.com/planetschool/)

We'll also have Planeteers available throughout EVENT to help answer any
questions you might have.

### Tell me about demos, again?

Sure!

One of the best parts of any hackathon is the opportunity to see what everyone
has been working on. On DEMOTIME, we'll gather together (virtually - via zoom)
to show off what we've done.

Note that a "demo" is not expected to be polished and flawless: think of this
as a casual lightning talk. Each team/project will get up to 5 minutes to talk
about their project and what they did during EVENT. Slides are optional but
encouraged, as is live coding or project demos. 

### Sounds good, what do I do now?

Head on over to the issue tracker & introduce yourself!
