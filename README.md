# Hello, World

Welcome to EVENT. 

## How to Participate

- create an issue to introduce yourself

- (optional) create an issue to pitch your hack idea

- interact with introductions & pitches during the week prior to EVENT

## How EVENT Works

- On KICKOFF, join the Kickoff session via Zoom (a link will be emailed to you)
- Following kickoff, hackers (whether working solo or in teams) will have until
  END to work on their ideas
- Before ENDTIME, sign up to demo your hack adventures using [FORM]this form
- At DEMOTIME, join the Demo Party on Zoom: everyone that signs up to demo will
  get 5 minutes to show us what they worked on - remember, no one expects to
_complete_ something from start-to-finish during a hackathon, part of the fun
is seeing what you can do in the time allotted!
