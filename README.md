- Use this [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/planetlabs-community/planet-hack-2020?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) to chat with other Planet Hack 2020 hackers

Note that team formation can happen anytime in the days leading up to Planet
Hack - but hacking should not begin until **Thursday, October 15th**!

## How Planet Hack 2020 Works

- At **9am PDT** on **Thursday, October 15th**, join the Kickoff session via Zoom (information on how to join will be emailed to you)
  
- Following kickoff, hackers (whether working solo or in teams) will have until **5pm PDT** on **Friday, October 16th** to work on their ideas

- Hackers & teams can choose to collaborate using whatever tools work best for them: you can request creation of a private team chat room by asking in the main [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/planetlabs-community/planet-hack-2020?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link)

- Periodic check-ins and Planeteer Office Hours will take place over the two days of Planet Hack 2020: stay tuned to the [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/planetlabs-community/planet-hack-2020?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) for the latest updates
  
- Before **5pm PDT** on the 16th, sign up to demo your hack adventures using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-9xa2D9dDEcQJ1E7l1IPMrzYzYiZeRvuyq9Ly0aaCI-K2Pg/viewform?usp=sf_link)

- At **6pm PDT** on the 16th, join the Demo Party on Zoom: everyone that signs up to demo will get 5 minutes to show everyone what they worked on -
remember, no one expects to _complete_ something from start-to-finish during a hackathon, part of the fun is seeing what you can do in the time allotted!

## Zoom Office Hours

During this two-day event, Planeteers (volunteers from Planet's engineering team) will be hosting virtual "office hours" in Zoom. Drop in to meet a Planeteer, get help, or ask questions.

See below for a schedule of these office hours: Zoom links will be posted in the Gitter chat room prior to each event.

## Planet Hack 2020 FAQ

### Is there a Code of Conduct?

Yes: all attendees, sponsors, partners, volunteers and staff are required to
agree with our [Event Code of Conduct](https://developers.planet.com/codeofconduct/).

If you experience or witness an incident and wish to make a report, [use this
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8b8uuyvZuqHX6Njd66Daud9PwsjlTatWjCx9rlsAMkh0KFw/viewform).

### Will there be prizes?

Unlike some hackathons, Planet Hack is non-competitive, and likewise there will be no
judging & no prizes. Instead, Planet Hack is a collaborative, creative event where we
can ask questions and explore ideas in a shared (virtual) space.

### I don't have a Planet account, how can I access Planet data?

An account will be configured for you in the days leading up to Planet Hack: you'll
receive an email with instructions on how to complete account setup.

For the duration of Planet Hack, you will have access to PlanetScope data around the
globe. You'll be able to browse & download data by logging in at [Planet
Explorer](https://www.planet.com/explorer/), or by accessing [Planet
APIs](https://developers.planet.com/docs/apis/) using your new account's API
key.

**Note:** if you _already_ have a Planet account, global PlanetScope data
access for the hackathon period will be added to your subscription if needed.

### I don't know anything about Planet data or satellite imagery in general, where should I start?

- You may find this [Introduction to Geospatial Data](https://developers.planet.com/planetschool/geospatial-data/) useful, as well as this [Satellite Imagery Overview](https://developers.planet.com/planetschool/satellite-imagery/)

- For a quickstart guide to usings Planet's platform & APIs, [see here](https://developers.planet.com/quickstart/)

- To browse our collection of self-guided tutorials, check out [Planet School](https://developers.planet.com/planetschool/)

We'll also have Planeteers available throughout Planet Hack to help answer any
questions you might have.

### Tell me about demos, again?

Sure!

One of the best parts of any hackathon is the opportunity to see what everyone
has been working on. On Friday, October 16th, we'll gather together (virtually - via zoom)
to show off what we've done.

To submit your demo, each team/hacker should [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-9xa2D9dDEcQJ1E7l1IPMrzYzYiZeRvuyq9Ly0aaCI-K2Pg/viewform?usp=sf_link) **before 5pm
PDT on October 16th**.

Note that a "demo" is not expected to be polished and flawless: think of this
as a casual lightning talk. Each team/project will get up to 5 minutes to talk
about their project and what they did during Planet Hack. Slides are optional but
encouraged, as is live coding or project demos. 

### Sounds good, what do I do now?

Head on over to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/planetlabs-community/planet-hack-2020/issues/new/choose) & [introduce yourself](https://github.com/planetlabs-community/planet-hack-2020/issues/new?assignees=&labels=introduction&template=hacker-introductions.md&title=%5BINTRO%5D+)!
